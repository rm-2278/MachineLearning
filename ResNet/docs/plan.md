1. Implement ResBlock
    1.1 Implement BasicBlock, which is simpler and more basic - two 3x3 convs
    1.2 Implement BottleBlock, which reduces training time - 1x1, 3x3, 1x1 conv
2. Implement ResNet using ResBlock
3. Downloading the dataset and preprocessing it
4. Creating the training loop 5. Creating the validation loop
